# What is Interface Builder's object library?

It contains objects which a developer or designer will need to provide to create the visual aspect of the app that the end-user will see. 

# What is the difference between an outlet and an action?

An outlet is the connection or controller connected to the view, which only holds information visibly that will not touch the model without the use of an action. 

Actions let yoou insert code that respond to user behavior that is sources in items in user interface builder. In other words, the app's actions help bridge the view and model.

# What is the role of a View Controller?

The view controller is what connects to the model controller. It helps modify the UI based on the information it receives.

# What is Model-View-Controller & why use Model-View-Controller?

A system in which the app's data and interface are decoupled, allowing to extensibility and reusability, as well as better maintained code. The controller is what helps the model and view communicate and respond to each other, largely based on the user's behavior. Since the model and view are decoupled, this allows developers to reuse the model or view in other apps without having to manually seperate the code that would've been interwoven, such as an HTML page with inline CSS.
